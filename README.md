LEDcube_3by3by3
===============

This is the code for running a 3x3x3 LED cube powered by an Arduino and using the Arduino programming language. It
currently works where the user inputs the pattern before uploading the code to the Arduino. Using this code as a base 
and along with other friends, I built an 8x8x8 LED cube which people could interact with using an iPad. We used 
Processing to communicate between the iPad and Arduino. Here is a link to a video of the 8x8x8 LED Cube -
